🚀 Mission Explorer – School Web Project
📖 Overview

This project is an improved version of a website I previously developed. The goal was to enhance its structure, interactivity, and user experience using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The website allows users to browse missions, filter them, search, add favorites, and even manage (CRUD) mission data dynamically.

✨ Features
🧭 General Improvements

Rebuilt and improved all pages using clean and responsive HTML and CSS.

Enhanced layout, colors, and animations for a modern user experience.

🛰️ Missions Page

Added more missions to the JSON data file.

Filter by Agency: View missions from a specific space agency (e.g., NASA, ESA, SpaceX).

Filter by Launch Year: Quickly find missions by their launch date.

Filter by Favorites: Display only your favorite missions.

Search Bar: Search missions by name, content, or agency.

🧩 CRUD Operations

Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing missions:

Add a new mission.

Read and display all missions dynamically.

Edit mission details and cancel editing anytime.

Delete a mission easily.

Favorite Button: Mark/unmark missions as favorites for quick access.

💬 Contact Page

Improved contact form validation with JavaScript:

✅ Email validation (checks if it’s a valid Gmail or email format).

✅ Phone number validation (accepts formats like +1 (148) 655-3126).

✅ Field check – Ensures all form fields are filled before submission.

❌ Error messages appear dynamically if a field is invalid or empty.

🧠 Extra Interactivity

A floating button opens a small modal/page when clicked (for favorites or other actions).

Smooth animations and transitions for better UX.
